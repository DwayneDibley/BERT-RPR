Bert Remote Procedure Registry (BERT-RPR)
=========================================

The BERT Remote Procedure Registry allows a program to expose or locate BERT-RPC
callable functions or object methods in the network.

The BERT-RPR simply contains a register of functions, theit network location,
and other information necessary to make the functions or object methods usable
by external programs.

When the Remote Procedure Registry is started, it does two things.

1 - It starts a broadcast listener to respond to broadcast messages that may
    arrive from clients trying to find a BERT-RPR. Note that the broadcast
    listener     is not started if the main server is listening on the loopback
    interface (127.0.0.1).

2 - It listens on the default network interface (unless specified otherwise) for
    Remote Procedure Registry requests.

The client routines necessary are provided by the BERT-RPR-CLIENT. The client
provides a local interface, and the necessary logic to locate the BERT-RPR.

Locating a BERT-RPR.
====================
The BERT Remote Procedure Locator will try 3 ways to find a BERT Remote Procedure
Registry (BERT-RPR):

1 - Try the local machine on the default BERT-RPR port.
2 - Try a list of places supplied when the procedure locator is called.
3 - Broadcast for a BERT-RPR.

The first BERT-RPR found will be used to resolve BERT-RPC calls.

The BERT-RPR Interface
======================
The BERT Remote Procedure Registry interface provides:

- The registration of BERT-RPC functions or object methods.
- The location of BERT-RPC functions or object methods.
- Updating the status of BERT-RPC functions or object methods.

The BERT-RPR Interface exposes the following methods through the "bert_rpr"
module:

resolve(module, function):
    Find the host(s) and port(s) corresponding to the given module and function.
    A list of host, port tuples is returned.

register(module, function, meta, host, port)
    Registers a function and its containing module.
    module is the module name for the RPC call.
    function is the function name for the RPC call.
    meta is the meta data (a string)
    host the name of the host serving the RPC
    port is the port on which the RPC will be served.

deregister_module(module, hostname, port)
    Removes the module served from the given host and port with the given name
    from the naming database.

deregister_function(module, function, hostname, port)
    Removes the function with the given module and function names served from
    the given host and port from the naming database.

ping()
    Test that the BERT-RPR is running.

get_modules()
    Returns a list of registered modules.

get_functions(module)
    Returns a list of the functions that the module exposes.

get_metadata(module [, function])
    Returns a list of the metadata asssociated with the module or function.

dump()
    returns the contents of the BERT-RPR in the following format.

    {
    <module>: {
            <function>: {
                (<host>, <port>): <metadata>,
                ......
                (<host>, <port>): <metadata>
                },
            .......
            <function>: {
                (<host>, <port>): <metadata>,
                ......
                (<host>, <port>): <metadata>
                }
            },
    .....
    <module>: {
            <function>: {
                (<host>, <port>): <metadata>,
                ......
                (<host>, <port>): <metadata>
                },
            .......
            <function>: {
                (<host>, <port>): <metadata>,
                ......
                (<host>, <port>): <metadata>
                }
            },
    }
