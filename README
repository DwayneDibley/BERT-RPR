Bert Remote Procedure Registry (BERT-RPR)
=========================================

The BERT Remote Procedure Registry allows a program to expose or locate BERT-RPC
callable functions or object methods in the network.

The BERT-RPR simply contains a register of functions, their network locations,
and other information necessary to make the functions or object methods findable 
and usable by external programs.

The specification is a work in progress, and will probably change.

Any bugs, comments or questions, raise an issue on github.

Requires.
=========
This is being developed using Python 2.6 and will be tested on both Windows XP 
and Ubuntu Linux.

Getting Started
===============
- Download the sources somewhere.
- cd demo
- python tutorial.py
- Now read the tutorial code and compare it with the output, and most things 
  should be clear.
- The spec is to be found under doc

Progress.
=========
258:	Mostly works on windows, haven't tested on linux yet, but I have no reason 
      to believe that there is anything windows specific here.
248:	The simple demo now works using defaults ...
